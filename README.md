Compare and find the ideal DAW for your needs.

This open-source and non-profit project is meant to help out bedroom
producers, audiophile hobbyists & bands who are just starting out to
find the perfect digital audio workstation (DAW) for their use case.

## Interested in contributing to the project ?

For bugs, just open a pull request.

For new feature requests, you can open a new issue and see if it finds approval.

## Help appreciated to keep the content up to date !

Since there is no API for DAWs, the information is mostly static and will need continous content updates.

It would be awesome if you could help out with the growing number of DAWs, which will need description, version & price updates.
