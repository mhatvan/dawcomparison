## Cakewalk is back!

After BandLab Technologies acquired the intellectual property of SONAR's Cakewalk Inc. in 2018, they relaunched Cakewalk as free-to-download software and continued development and adding new features. Amazing things do happen!

### Precision audio technology

Never worry about audio quality again: Cakewalk offers you clean, dynamic and accurate mixes through its advanced 64-bit mix engine and provides you with the highest quality audio possible with resampling plugins. With excellent built-in mastering tools, you can polish your finished mix and directly export and publish it to various channels including SoundCloud, YouTube and many more.
