## Cubase has been around for a long time due to its stability and trustworthiness

Supported and used by many big name producers like Hans Zimmer and TiÃ«sto, Cubase can convince its userbase with an intuitive MIDI engine and great stability. The amount of world-class stock plugins give you options out of the box for serious mixing and composition work.

### Turn your ideas into music

There are no limits to what you can do with Cubase. Creating musical sequences, recording vocalists or instruments, mixing and mastering multi-track projects, it all works intuitively without hickups. Even basic sound editing to a video track is possible.

### Opt-in for Cubasis

If Cubase alone doesn't offer you enough flexibility, you can purchase its companion tablet app for recording, editing and mixing on an iPad.

### Currently, you can get Cubase 10.5 in three different versions

- Elements (\$110)
- Artist (\$360)
- Pro (\$640)
